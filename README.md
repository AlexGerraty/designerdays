## Difficulties with Rendering Data on `/designer/:designerId`

One of the challenges faced in the app is with rendering data on the `/designer/:designerId` URL. This difficulty arises due to the asynchronous nature of fetching designer data from the backend and rendering it on the frontend. Since data fetching operations can take time to complete, there may be delays in loading designer details, resulting in empty or incomplete content being displayed to the user.
